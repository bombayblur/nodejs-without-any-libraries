# node.js server without a single 3rd party library

Why would I do this to myself?
Simply because i wanted to explore the native apis offered by the node.js runtime.
I was actually surprised by how good the native APIs are, but they do introduce boiler plate.

It made me more appreciative of libraries like express.js
